# Willis Unity Prototype 0.01

This project was imported using the **Unity 2020.3.x** empty base project.

This is a Unity Prototype-project created for an introductory course on Unity, used only for trying out different features of the engine. For everybody outside of the course, this project probably isn´t of much value or use.

## Getting Started

The project is currently not being built. To run it, simply clone or download the repo and open it in the Unity-Editor.

### Prerequisites

The Project is currently not being built and, as such, has no dependencies. To run it anyway, simply open it in Unity-Editor. Version 2020.3.18 is recommended, although any 2020.3.xx should work.

### Installing

You can find instructions on how to install and use Unity at their website.
https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/UnityManual.html
These instructions will not be paraphrased here because the Unity-documentation is sufficient for the installation-process needed for this project.

## Built With
